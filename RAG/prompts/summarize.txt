<USER1> 

"I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed lately. Work has been demanding, and I can’t seem to find time for myself. It feels like I’m on autopilot, just going through the motions. Even when I try to relax, my mind keeps racing, and I start thinking about all the things I haven’t done yet."

<SUMMARY1>

"Feeling overwhelmed by work demands and struggling to relax due to constant overthinking."

<USER2>

"Today was actually a good day. I went for a morning run, and the weather was perfect—cool and sunny. Later, I met up with an old friend, and we had a great conversation about life. It’s rare to feel this at peace, and I’m really grateful for moments like this."

<SUMMARY2>

"Felt peaceful and grateful after a productive day and a meaningful conversation with a friend."
